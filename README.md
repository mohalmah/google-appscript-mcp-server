# Postman MCP Generator

Welcome to your generated MCP server! üöÄ This project was created with the [Postman MCP Generator](https://postman.com/explore/mcp-generator), configured to [Model Context Provider (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) Server output mode. It provides you with:

- ‚úÖ An MCP-compatible server (`mcpServer.js`)
- ‚úÖ Automatically generated JavaScript tools for each selected Postman API request
- ‚úÖ OAuth 2.0 authentication for Google Apps Script API

## üîÑ Authentication Update

**Important**: This server has been updated to use OAuth 2.0 authentication instead of API keys for the Google Apps Script API. Please see the `OAUTH_SETUP.md` file for detailed setup instructions.

Let's set things up!

## üö¶ Getting Started

### ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

Before starting, please ensure you have:

- [Node.js (v18+ required, v20+ recommended)](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (included with Node)

Warning: if you run with a lower version of Node, `fetch` won't be present. Tools use `fetch` to make HTTP calls. To work around this, you can modify the tools to use `node-fetch` instead. Make sure that `node-fetch` is installed as a dependency and then import it as `fetch` into each tool file.

### üì• Installation & Setup

**1. Install dependencies**

Run from your project's root directory:

```sh
npm install
```

### üîê Set up OAuth Authentication

The Google Apps Script API uses OAuth 2.0 authentication. You'll need to set up OAuth credentials instead of using API keys.

**Step 1**: Follow the detailed setup guide in `OAUTH_SETUP.md` to:
- Create OAuth 2.0 credentials in Google Cloud Console
- Enable required APIs
- Obtain a refresh token

**Step 2**: Update your `.env` file with OAuth credentials:

```env
# Google Apps Script API OAuth Configuration
GOOGLE_APP_SCRIPT_API_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
GOOGLE_APP_SCRIPT_API_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
GOOGLE_APP_SCRIPT_API_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_refresh_token_here
```

Replace the placeholder values with your actual OAuth credentials obtained in Step 1.

**Important**: The Google Apps Script API requires OAuth authentication for accessing script projects, deployments, and processes. API keys alone are not sufficient for these operations.

## üåê Test the MCP Server with Postman

The MCP Server (`mcpServer.js`) exposes your automated API tools to MCP-compatible clients, such as Claude Desktop or the Postman Desktop Application. We recommend that you test the server with Postman first and then move on to using it with an LLM.

The Postman Desktop Application is the easiest way to run and test MCP servers. Testing the downloaded server first is optional but recommended.

**Step 1**: Download the latest Postman Desktop Application from [https://www.postman.com/downloads/](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).

**Step 2**: Read out the documentation article [here](https://learning.postman.com/docs/postman-ai-agent-builder/mcp-requests/create/) and see how to create an MCP request inside the Postman app.

**Step 3**: Set the type of the MCP request to `STDIO` and set the command to `node </absolute/path/to/mcpServer.js>`. If you have issues with using only `node` (e.g. an old version is used), supply an absolute path instead to a node version 18+. You can get the full path to node by running:

```sh
which node
```

To check the node version, run:

```sh
node --version
```

To get the absolute path to `mcpServer.js`, run:

```sh
realpath mcpServer.js
```

Use the node command followed by the full path to `mcpServer.js` as the command for your new Postman MCP Request. Then click the **Connect** button. You should see a list of tools that you selected before generating the server. You can test that each tool works here before connecting the MCP server to an LLM.

## üë©‚Äçüíª Connect the MCP Server to Claude

You can connect your MCP server to any MCP client. Here we provide instructions for connecting it to Claude Desktop.

**Step 1**: Note the full path to node and the `mcpServer.js` from the previous step.

**Step 2**. Open Claude Desktop ‚Üí **Settings** ‚Üí **Developers** ‚Üí **Edit Config** and add a new MCP server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "<server_name>": {
      "command": "<absolute/path/to/node>",
      "args": ["<absolute/path/to/mcpServer.js>"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop to activate this change. Make sure the new MCP is turned on and has a green circle next to it. If so, you're ready to begin a chat session that can use the tools you've connected.

**Warning**: If you don't supply an absolute path to a `node` version that is v18+, Claude (and other MCP clients) may fall back to another `node` version on the system of a previous version. In this case, the `fetch` API won't be present and tool calls will not work. If that happens, you can a) install a newer version of node and point to it in the command, or b) import `node-fetch` into each tool as `fetch`, making sure to also add the `node-fetch` dependency to your package.json.

### Additional Options

#### üê≥ Docker Deployment (Production)

For production deployments, you can use Docker:

**1. Build Docker image**

```sh
docker build -t <your_server_name> .
```

**2. Claude Desktop Integration**

Add Docker server configuration to Claude Desktop (Settings ‚Üí Developers ‚Üí Edit Config):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "<your_server_name>": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["run", "-i", "--rm", "--env-file=.env", "<your_server_name>"]
    }
  }
}
```

> Add your environment variables (API keys, etc.) inside the `.env` file.

The project comes bundled with the following minimal Docker setup:

```dockerfile
FROM node:22.12-alpine AS builder

WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm install

COPY . .

ENTRYPOINT ["node", "mcpServer.js"]
```

#### üåê Server-Sent Events (SSE)

To run the server with Server-Sent Events (SSE) support, use the `--sse` flag:

```sh
node mcpServer.js --sse
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Additional CLI commands

#### List tools

List descriptions and parameters from all generated tools with:

```sh
node index.js tools
```

Example:

```
Available Tools:

Workspace: acme-workspace

## ‚ûï Adding New Tools

Extend your MCP server with more tools easily:

1. Visit [Postman MCP Generator](https://postman.com/explore/mcp-generator).
2. Pick new API request(s), generate a new MCP server, and download it.
3. Copy new generated tool(s) into your existing project's `tools/` folder.
